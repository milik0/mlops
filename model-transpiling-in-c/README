# ML Model Transpiling to C

This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model in Python and transpile it to C code for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## What it does

1. **Trains** a linear regression model to predict house prices based on size, number of rooms, and garden presence
2. **Transpiles** the trained model into standalone C code
3. **Compiles** and executes the C program to verify predictions match the Python model

## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Train the model

```bash
python3 train_model.py
```

This creates `regression.joblib` with the trained model.

### 3. Transpile to C

```bash
python3 transpile_simple_model.py
```

This generates `model.c`, compiles it to `./model`, and runs a test prediction.

### 4. Run the C program

```bash
./model
```
